# Hey, I'm Hexager! 👋
I am a student based in India 🇮🇳 . I mostly use my Github to store my personal coding projects and display them (well the ones I am kinda proud of atleast).
## 🧐 About Me
I like learning about Artificial intelligence, and machine learning. As a hobby, I dabble in 3D Modelling and Animation, as well as Video Editing.




## 🧠 I'm currently learning...
 1) The prequisite math behind Artificial Intelligence
 2) Website Design
